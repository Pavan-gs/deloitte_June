Problems with traditional file approach
-----------------------------------------------------

Data isolation, Redudancy, security

Db --> Collection of information in the organised manner --> Easy for retrieval

DBMS --> Collection of files and programs to efficiently store & manage the data

Users of DB
----------------
End user
DB Designer
DBA
Application programmer

Schema
-----------
Three Schema Architecture --> Database, Internal schema, Conceptual schema

Db Model  --> Blueprint
-------------

Relational data model   --> RDBMS
------------------------------

Relations --> Two dimensional tables (Unique attributes[columns] & tuples[rows])

NULL --> Unknown value

Keys 
------

Primary keys  --> Cannot be NULL & should be unique 

Composite primary keys --> Combination of more than one attribute

Foreign keys[Referential Integrity] --> Set of attributes whose values are required to match the values of the column in another table

FK of the parent table needs to be unique.
FK of the child table need not be unique and can be NULL.

Entity Relationship Models : Entity, Cardinality (Degree of relationship), Shapes 

12. Shapes : 

	Rectangle : Entity

	Ellipses : Attributes

	Diamonds : Relationship

	Lines : Link b/w Attributes, Entities & Relationships

                Double Ellipses : Multi Valued Attributes

	Dashed Ellipses : Derived Attributes

	Double Lines : Total Participation

	Dashed Lines : WIthout Primary key

	Solid Line : Stronger Entity

	Double Rectangles : Weak Entity

	 Single Line : Partial Participation

Cardinality --> 1 to 1, 1 to M, M to 1, M to M

# Make a ER diagram having tables as follows,

1. Person : Driver_ID, Name, Address

2. Car : License, Year, Model

3. Accident : Report num, Date, Location

4. Participated : Driver ID, License, Report num, Damage fine

1 NF ---> Make sure all the variables are atomic

2 NF --> Table shjould be in 1 NF & No partial dependency between non-key attributes [Non key attribute should not depend only on one composite key)


DB OBJECTS   --> Tables, Indexes, Views, Synonyms, Sequence

# Data Types:  Char, Varchar2, Number, Long, Datetime

Char => Fixed length character data
Varchar => Variable length character data  
number => Variable length numeric data
Date =>Date & time values
Long => Variable length character data (2 GB)

# Constraints : PK, FK, NULL, Default, Check, Unique
